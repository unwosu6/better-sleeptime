# SleepTime App
 
A simple web application similar to [sleepyti.me](https://sleepopolis.com/calculators/sleep/) but limited to suggesting "wake up" times based on calculating [sleep cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle).

- A sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes, and a good night's sleep consists of 5-6 sleep cycles.
- If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle, you will feel groggy even if you've completed several cycles before waking up.
